Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

The computer couldn't compute anything because we told it to look for the variable "lineum." When I commented out the line "lineum = 0" it stopped lineum from being a variable. When we tried to use that variable in "lineum = lineum + 1", the computer obviously failed because that variable doesn't exist.

If you commented out "gc_count = 0" the same thing would happen because you're trying to use a variable that the computer doesn't know exists.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.56970737037

Collaboration:

None

Reflection:
This assignment was actually very helpful. It had good easy to understand guided instructions and it allowed me to dive into a code, change it up, and see the results of my changes first hand. I honestly wouldn't do it any differently. My advice to future students is to study using things like terminal and commands.
